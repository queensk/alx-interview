# Pascal's Triangle

## Introduction
This is a Python program that generates Pascal's Triangle. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers where the first and last elements of each row are 1, and every other element is the sum of the two elements directly above it. The triangle is named after Blaise Pascal, a 17th-century French mathematician.

## Requirements
This program requires Python 3 to be installed on your computer.

## How to Use
To run the program, simply execute the following command in your terminal:

```
./0-main.py
```
## How It Works
The program uses a nested loop to generate Pascal's Triangle. The outer loop iterates over each row, and the inner loop iterates over each element in the row. Each element is the sum of the two elements directly above it, except for the first and last elements of each row, which are always 1.
