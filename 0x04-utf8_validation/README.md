## Learning Objectives
What is UTF-8 and how does it work
How to check if a byte sequence is valid UTF-8
How to use different tools and libraries to validate UTF-8 data

## Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher
PEP 8 style
No external modules

## Tasks
Write a function that determines if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

Write a script that reads a file and checks if it is valid UTF-8 using the iconv command.

Write a script that reads a file and checks if it is valid UTF-8 using the chardet module.
