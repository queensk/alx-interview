# N-queens
This program solves the N-queens problem using backtracking. The N-queens problem is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard.

## Usage
The program takes one argument, which is the size of the board and the number of queens to place. The argument must be an integer greater or equal to 4.

## Example:
```
./0-nqueens.py 4
[[0, 1], [1, 3], [2, 0], [3, 2]]
[[0, 2], [1, 0], [2, 3], [3, 1]]
```

The program prints every possible solution to the problem, one per line. Each solution is a list of coordinates of the queens on the board, where the first number is the row and the second number is the column.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- sys module
